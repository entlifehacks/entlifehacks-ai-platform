## How It Works

1. User completes the AI assessment questionnaire
2. System generates personalized recommendations
3. User clicks "Download Full Report (PDF)" button
4. PDF is generated dynamically with all user data
5. Browser downloads the file as `ai-consulting-report.pdf`

## Customization Options

### Modify Colors
Edit the color values in `src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`:
```typescript
doc.setFillColor(0, 102, 255); // Primary blue
doc.setTextColor(255, 255, 255); // White text
```

### Add Company Logo
To add an image logo, use jsPDF's `addImage()` method:
```typescript
doc.addImage(logoData, 'PNG', x, y, width, height);
```

### Adjust Layout
Modify spacing and positioning by changing the `yPos` variable increments throughout the generation function.
